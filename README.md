# Schrodinger-Follmer Sampler for Gaussian Mixtures

This repository is the R demo implementation of [Schrodinger-Follmer Sampler for Gaussian Mixtures]. 


## Sampling on the 1D setting

To implement the sampling on 1D Gaussian Mixtures, run this command:

```train_toys_1d
Rscript demo_1d.R
```

## Sampling on the 2D setting

To implement the sampling on 2D Gaussian Mixtures, run this command:

```train_toys_2d
Rscript demo_2d.R
```
